# Build a CrewAI Flow

How to write a Flow that wires correctly, keeps typed state, persists and resumes, and calls crews and agents, on the current API.

Verified against crewai 1.15.22 and 1.15.23 on 2026-10-01.
Live-tested on CrewAI AMP and real LLMs on 2026-10-01.
Run `crewai version` first; if the major/minor differs from 1.15, re-verify version-sensitive rows with the `ask-docs` skill before trusting them.

Where the getting-started, design-agent or design-task skills in this plugin disagree with this skill, follow this skill - it was re-checked against crewai 1.15.22 and 1.15.23. The installed crewai source outranks both.

---

## 1. Scaffold and run a flow project

```bash
crewai create flow lead-router      # the package is still lead_router
cd lead_router
crewai install                      # uv sync; writes uv.lock
crewai run                          # runs the `kickoff` script in pyproject.toml
crewai flow plot                    # runs the `plot` script
```

What the scaffold gives you:

| File | Contents |
|---|---|
| `pyproject.toml` | `[project.scripts]` `kickoff`, `run_crew` (both `<pkg>.main:kickoff`), `plot`, `run_with_trigger`; `[tool.crewai] type = "flow"` |
| `src/<pkg>/main.py` | A `Flow[ContentState]` subclass plus `kickoff()` and `plot()` functions; `from crewai.flow import Flow, listen, start` |
| `src/<pkg>/crews/content_crew/` | A classic `@CrewBase` crew with `config/agents.yaml` and `config/tasks.yaml`; its agents set no `llm`, so they use the default OpenAI model |
| `.env` | `OPENAI_API_KEY=YOUR_API_KEY` - a placeholder; a run with it fails with `401 ... Incorrect API key provided` |
| `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `GEMINI.md` (plus `CURSOR.md` from 1.15.23), `README.md`, `tests/` | Coding-assistant instructions and an empty tests folder |
| `.git/` | `crewai create` runs `git init` (no commit, no remote) |

To use another provider, set `llm: anthropic/claude-haiku-4-5` (for example) on each agent in `agents.yaml`, run `uv add "crewai[anthropic]"`, and put `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=<your-key>` in `.env` - `crewai run` read the key from `.env` with nothing exported in the shell.

Rules the scaffold implies:

- Keep `[tool.crewai] type = "flow"`. The CLI uses it to decide that `crewai run` means `uv run kickoff`.
- The template's `plan_content()` overwrites `self.state.topic` with `"AI Agents"` unless a trigger payload is present, so `kickoff(inputs={"topic": ...})` (and a deployed kickoff's `inputs`) is ignored. Delete that assignment before relying on inputs.
- The template's `plot()` calls `plot()` with the default `show=True`, so `crewai flow plot` opens a browser. Change it to `plot("<name>.html", show=False)` for headless use.
- Import with the absolute package path (`from lead_router.crews.content_crew.content_crew import ContentCrew`), as the template does.
- `kickoff()` in `main.py` must return `None`. The generated console script does `sys.exit(kickoff())`, so returning the flow result (a dict, say) makes the process exit with status 1 and prints the value to stderr, and `crewai run` prints "An error occurred while running the flow" - yet `crewai run` itself still exits 0, so a CI step that only checks its exit code passes.
- `crewai run --inputs '{...}'` is rejected for a Python flow: `Error: --inputs requires a declarative flow definition ([tool.crewai].definition) or --definition`. Pass inputs in code (`flow.kickoff(inputs=...)`), or read them from `sys.argv` in your `kickoff()` and call `uv run kickoff '<json>'`.
- `crewai flow kickoff` still works but prints "deprecated. Use 'crewai run' instead."
- A placeholder or invalid key makes the flow fail, yet `crewai run` still exits 0 (it prints `An error occurred while running the flow: Command '['uv', 'run', 'kickoff']' returned non-zero exit status 1.`). Check for that line, not the exit code.

---

## 2. State: structured or dict

| | Structured (recommended) | Unstructured |
|---|---|---|
| Declare | `class MyFlow(Flow[MyState])` with `MyState(BaseModel)` | `class MyFlow(Flow)` |
| Access | `self.state.topic` | `self.state["topic"]` |
| `id` | Added for you (`self.state.id`, a UUID string) | `self.state["id"]` |
| Validation | `kickoff(inputs=...)` values are type-checked | none |

```python
from pydantic import BaseModel
from crewai.flow import Flow, listen, start


class ReportState(BaseModel):
    topic: str = ""          # give every field a default
    draft: str = ""
    notes: list[str] = []


class ReportFlow(Flow[ReportState]):
    @start()
    def plan(self):
        self.state.notes.append(f"planning {self.state.topic}")
        return self.state.topic.upper()

    @listen(plan)
    def write(self, plan_output):          # receives plan()'s return value
        self.state.draft = f"Draft about {plan_output}"
        return self.state.draft


flow = ReportFlow()
result = flow.kickoff(inputs={"topic": "bees"})   # inputs set state BEFORE @start runs
print(result)           # "Draft about BEES" - kickoff returns the last method's output
print(flow.state.id)    # UUID string, generated per run
```

State rules (each one prevents a real failure):

| Rule | What happens if you break it |
|---|---|
| Do not declare `id` on your model; `Flow[MyState]` adds it | A declared `id` default is silently replaced by a generated UUID |
| Use `Flow[MyState]`, not `initial_state = MyState` | `initial_state` with a plain `BaseModel`: `ValidationError ... Flow state model must have an 'id' field` |
| Give every field a default | A required field: `ValidationError` when the flow is instantiated, before `kickoff` |
| Use attribute access on structured state | `self.state["topic"]`: `TypeError: 'StateWithId' object is not subscriptable` |
| Spell `inputs` keys exactly like the model fields | Unknown keys are **silently dropped** on structured state |
| Pass `inputs` of the right type | `inputs={"topic": 5}`: `ValueError: Invalid inputs for structured state` |
| Never set `self.state.id` by hand | It is the persistence key; use `restore_from_state_id` (section 6) |

On a deployed flow (tested on CrewAI AMP, 2026-10-01), `GET /inputs` lists the state model's fields (every field except `id`), and the `inputs` object of `POST /kickoff` is applied to state exactly like `kickoff(inputs=...)`. A body without the `inputs` wrapper (`{"text": "..."}`) was still accepted (`200` and a `kickoff_id`) and the run succeeded on default state - the value never reached the flow. The run's `state.id` equalled its `kickoff_id`. Calling patterns: the **call-deployed-crew** skill.

---

## 3. Wiring: `@start`, `@listen`, `@router`

```python
from typing import Literal
from pydantic import BaseModel
from crewai.flow import Flow, listen, router, start


class TicketState(BaseModel):
    text: str = ""
    queue: str = ""


class TicketFlow(Flow[TicketState]):
    @start()
    def receive(self):
        return self.state.text

    @router(receive)
    def triage(self) -> Literal["urgent", "normal"]:   # labels, not method names
        return "urgent" if "outage" in self.state.text else "normal"

    @listen("urgent")
    def page_oncall(self):
        self.state.queue = "oncall"

    @listen("normal")
    def file_ticket(self):
        self.state.queue = "backlog"


flow = TicketFlow()
flow.kickoff(inputs={"text": "outage in eu-west"})
print(flow.state.queue)   # oncall
```

| Rule | Why |
|---|---|
| A router label must not equal the name of the method that listens for it | `@listen("go") def go` raises at instantiation: `Invalid flow definition for ...: methods.go.listen listen condition 'go' references the handler name 'go'. A listener triggered by its own completion creates an infinite loop.` Labels and method names share one namespace |
| Pick labels that match no method name at all | A label is just an event name, and so is every method name. A router that returns the name of the method that triggers it re-runs that branch until `RecursionError: Method 'r' has been called 100 times in this flow execution` |
| Make sure every label the router can return has a listener | An unmatched label ends the flow silently; `kickoff()` returns the label string itself |
| Declare labels with a `Literal[...]` return type or `@router(x, emit=[...])` | Only for `plot()` edges and static checks; `emit=` is not enforced at runtime (a router returning a label outside `emit` still ran) |
| `@listen(method_ref)` is safer than `@listen("method_name")` | A typo in a string is just an event nobody emits |

---

## 4. `or_` and `and_`

```python
from crewai.flow import Flow, and_, listen, or_, start

calls = []


class FanIn(Flow):
    @start()
    def fetch_a(self):
        return "A"

    @start()
    def fetch_b(self):
        return "B"

    @listen(or_(fetch_a, fetch_b))
    def first_result(self, value):
        calls.append(("or", value))

    @listen(and_(fetch_a, fetch_b))
    def all_results(self, value):
        calls.append(("and", value))


FanIn().kickoff()
print(calls)   # e.g. [('or', 'A'), ('and', 'B')] - the start methods run concurrently, so the values (and order) can vary
```

- **`or_` fires once per kickoff**, on the first condition to complete. It does not run again when the second one completes, so you do not need a "seen" flag.
- `or_` re-arms when a router emits one of its labels again. That is what makes a revision loop work (`@listen(or_(write_draft, "needs_revision"))` runs on the first draft and after each revision; see [routing-patterns](references/routing-patterns.md)).
- **`and_` fires once, after all conditions complete**, and receives the output of the last one to finish. Read the others from `self.state`.
- A typical join after a router: `@listen(or_(page_oncall, file_ticket))` runs exactly once, whichever branch ran.

---

## 5. Calling crews and agents from flow methods

```python
from crewai import Agent, Crew, Task
from crewai.flow import Flow, listen, start


class ResearchFlow(Flow):
    @start()
    def research(self):
        researcher = Agent(role="Researcher", goal="Research {topic}",
                           backstory="You find facts.", llm="openai/gpt-4o-mini")
        task = Task(description="List three facts about {topic}.",
                    expected_output="Three bullets.", agent=researcher)
        out = Crew(agents=[researcher], tasks=[task]).kickoff(inputs={"topic": "bees"})
        return out.raw                       # CrewOutput: .raw .pydantic .json_dict

    @listen(research)
    def summarize(self, facts):
        writer = Agent(role="Writer", goal="Summarize", backstory="Concise.",
                       llm="openai/gpt-4o-mini")
        return writer.kickoff(f"One sentence summary: {facts}").raw   # LiteAgentOutput
```

| Method kind | Call | Wrong form |
|---|---|---|
| `def` | `crew.kickoff(inputs=...)`, `agent.kickoff(...)` | - |
| `async def` | `await crew.akickoff(inputs=...)` | `crew.kickoff()` inside `async def`: `RuntimeError: Agent execution was invoked synchronously from within a running event loop` |

- Crew `{placeholders}` are filled from the crew's own `kickoff(inputs=...)`, not from flow state. A crew kicked off with no inputs sends the literal `{topic}` to the LLM. Pass the state values you need explicitly.
- Build the crew inside the method (or call `MyCrew().crew()` from a `@CrewBase` class each time), so each run gets fresh objects.
- Flow methods are plain methods: `ReportFlow().plan()` can be called directly in a unit test.

---

## 6. Persistence with `@persist`

```python
from pydantic import BaseModel
from crewai.flow import Flow, persist, start   # or: from crewai.flow.persistence import persist


class CounterState(BaseModel):
    count: int = 0


@persist()                      # class level: state saved after every method
class CounterFlow(Flow[CounterState]):
    @start()
    def bump(self):
        self.state.count += 1
        return self.state.count


first = CounterFlow()
first.kickoff()                                        # count == 1
second = CounterFlow()
second.kickoff(restore_from_state_id=first.state.id)   # count == 2
print(second.state.id != first.state.id)               # True: a fork with a new id
```

| You want | Do | Not |
|---|---|---|
| Import | `from crewai.flow import persist` or `from crewai.flow.persistence import persist` | `from crewai.flow.flow import persist` (ImportError) |
| Decorate | `@persist()` - always with parentheses | Bare `@persist` on a class: the class is replaced by a function and instantiating it raises `TypeError: persist.<locals>.decorator() missing 1 required positional argument: 'target'`. Bare `@persist` on a method: **no error at all** - the method body never runs, `kickoff()` returns the flow object, nothing is saved |
| Seed a new run from a saved state | `kickoff(restore_from_state_id=sid)` - hydrates, then writes under a fresh `state.id` | `kickoff(inputs={"id": sid})` - deprecated; resumes under the same id and gives no warning |
| Save only at a checkpoint-worthy step | `@persist()` on that method (stack it above `@listen`) | Class-level when you only need the final state |
| Change some fields on the restored run | Pass them in `inputs` with `restore_from_state_id`; inputs are applied after hydration | Editing the SQLite file |

Where it stores state, and the silent cases:

- Default backend: `SQLiteFlowPersistence`, file `flow_states.db` in `appdirs.user_data_dir(<CREWAI_STORAGE_DIR or current dir name>, "CrewAI")` - on macOS `~/Library/Application Support/<name>/`, on Linux `~/.local/share/<name>/`. Set `CREWAI_STORAGE_DIR` to an **absolute path** and the file lands directly in that directory. Or pass a path: `@persist(SQLiteFlowPersistence("/abs/path/flows.db"))`.
- An unknown `restore_from_state_id` does not raise: it logs "No flow state found ... proceeding without hydration" and runs from defaults.
- `restore_from_state_id` on a flow **without** `@persist` is ignored silently.
- Locally `@persist` is a SQLite file. For durable state you control, implement `FlowPersistence` against your own database ([persistence-and-checkpoints](references/persistence-and-checkpoints.md)).

On CrewAI AMP (tested 2026-10-01 with a class-level `@persist()` flow deployed by ZIP upload), send the id as a top-level `restoreFromStateId` beside `inputs` in `POST /kickoff`:

| Kickoff body | Observed |
|---|---|
| `{"inputs": {...}, "restoreFromStateId": "<state_id>"}` | State restored (counter and list carried over, fields not in `inputs` kept), `inputs` applied on top, new `state.id` (= the new `kickoff_id`) |
| Same, after two `crewai deploy push` redeploys | Still restored - the saved state survived the redeploys |
| `restoreFromStateId` that matches nothing | No error; the run starts from defaults |
| `{"inputs": {"id": "<state_id>", ...}}` (deprecated) | Restored and kept the **old** `state.id`, which then differs from the `kickoff_id` |

Return `self.state.id` from the last method (or read the `kickoff_id`) so callers have the id to restore from.

---

## 7. Checkpointing (resume after a crash)

Checkpoints are separate from `@persist`: they snapshot the run (state, completed methods, outputs) to files so a failed run can continue.

```python
from crewai import CheckpointConfig
from crewai.flow import Flow, listen, start


class EtlFlow(Flow):
    @start()
    def extract(self):
        return "rows"

    @listen(extract)
    def load(self, rows):
        return f"loaded {rows}"


flow = EtlFlow(checkpoint=CheckpointConfig(
    location="./.checkpoints",
    on_events=["method_execution_finished"],   # required for flows, see below
))
flow.kickoff()
```

Resume: `EtlFlow().kickoff(from_checkpoint=CheckpointConfig(restore_from="./.checkpoints/<branch>/<file>.json"))`. Completed methods are skipped. To change state before continuing (for example to clear a flag that caused the failure), use `flow = EtlFlow.from_checkpoint(CheckpointConfig(restore_from=path))`, edit `flow.state`, then `flow.kickoff()`.

- **On a Flow, set `on_events=["method_execution_finished"]`.** The default `["task_completed"]` (and `checkpoint=True`) wrote no checkpoint at all for a flow, even one whose method ran a crew.
- Files are written under `location/<branch>/` as `<timestamp>_<id>_p-<parent>.json`, one per finished method. The timestamp has one-second resolution and the id is random, so **sorting file names does not find the latest** when several methods finish in the same second (a sorted list picked the second-to-last). Use `max(files, key=os.path.getmtime)`, or `crewai checkpoint list <location>` (newest first).
- **Resume does not continue past a router.** A checkpoint taken after a `@router` (or a `@human_feedback` method with `emit`) has finished resumes, runs nothing, and returns the router's label (or `None`) with no error - the label's listeners never run. A crash anywhere downstream of a router therefore cannot be resumed from the latest checkpoint; only checkpoints taken before the router finished continue through it. Verified on 1.15.22 and 1.15.23. Keep crash-prone work upstream of routers, or make the downstream steps idempotent and re-run the flow.
- `kickoff(from_checkpoint=..., restore_from_state_id=...)` raises `ValueError: Cannot combine ...`. Pick one system.

---

## 8. Human feedback (`@human_feedback`)

```python
from crewai.flow import Flow, HumanFeedbackResult, human_feedback, listen, start


class ReviewFlow(Flow):
    @start()
    @human_feedback(
        message="Approve this draft?",
        emit=["needs_revision", "approved"],
        llm="openai/gpt-4o-mini",            # maps free-text feedback to one label
        default_outcome="needs_revision",    # used when feedback is empty
    )
    def draft(self):
        return "Draft v1"

    @listen("approved")
    def publish(self, result: HumanFeedbackResult):
        return f"published: {result.output} ({result.feedback})"

    @listen("needs_revision")
    def revise(self, result: HumanFeedbackResult):
        return f"revise: {result.feedback}"
```

- `HumanFeedbackResult` fields: `output`, `feedback`, `outcome`, `timestamp`, `method_name`, `metadata`. The text is **`result.feedback`** (`feedback_text` raises AttributeError). Also on the flow: `self.last_human_feedback`, `self.human_feedback_history`.
- Empty feedback -> `default_outcome`, or `emit[0]` if no default. Put the safe outcome first and set it as `default_outcome`, so pressing Enter never approves.
- Non-empty feedback that the LLM cannot map to a label raises `HumanFeedbackCollapseError` - it does not fall back.
- Non-empty feedback is mapped by `llm`: with `anthropic/claude-haiku-4-5`, "Looks good to me, ship it." became `approved` and "No, the tone is wrong - please rewrite it more politely." became `needs_revision`; the original text stays in `result.feedback`.
- `default_outcome` without `emit` raises `ValueError: default_outcome requires emit to be specified.`
- Without `emit`, the next listener gets the `HumanFeedbackResult` and no routing happens.
- The default provider reads the console. Pass `provider=` (an object with `request_feedback(context, flow) -> str`) for tests or a UI; raise `HumanFeedbackPending` from it to pause, then `MyFlow.from_pending(flow_id, persistence).resume(feedback)` later ([persistence-and-checkpoints](references/persistence-and-checkpoints.md)). With no stdin (CI, `< /dev/null`, a background job) the console provider raises `EOFError: EOF when reading a line` and the flow fails. Never use `input()` in a deployed flow.

---

## 9. `plot()`

```python
path = TicketFlow().plot("ticket_flow.html", show=False)
print(path)   # /tmp/.../crewai_flow_xxxx/ticket_flow.html
```

- `plot(filename="crewai_flow.html", show=True)` writes **interactive HTML (plus a .js and .css) into a new temp directory** and returns the absolute path. Nothing is written to the current directory and there is no PNG. Copy the files if you need to keep them.
- The filename is used as given: `plot("my_flow")` writes a file named `my_flow` with no `.html` extension.
- `show=True` opens a browser; use `show=False` in CI and headless runs.
- Routers without a `Literal[...]` return type or `emit=[...]` log "Router events for 'r' are dynamic or not statically inferable" and the graph may omit their edges. The graph data lives in the `.js` file, not the `.html`.

---

## 10. Conversational flows

For multi-turn chat, import from `crewai.flow` (`ConversationConfig`, `ConversationState`, `RouterConfig`); `crewai.experimental.conversational` is a deprecated alias of the same module. Drive turns with `flow.handle_turn(message, session_id=...)`, not `kickoff(user_message=...)` (TypeError). There is no `ChatSession` class. Details and a tested example: [conversational-flows](references/conversational-flows.md).

---

## 11. Common mistakes

| Symptom | Cause | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| `ImportError: cannot import name 'persist'` | `from crewai.flow.flow import persist` | `from crewai.flow import persist` |
| `TypeError: persist.<locals>.decorator() missing 1 required positional argument: 'target'`, or a method that never runs | Bare `@persist` without parentheses | `@persist()` |
| `listen condition 'x' references the handler name 'x'` | Router label equals the listening method's name | Rename the label or the method |
| `RecursionError: Method 'r' has been called 100 times` | Router returned a label equal to a method name (often its own trigger) | Use labels that are not method names |
| Flow stops after the router, no error | Router returned a label with no `@listen` | Listen for every label; type the router `-> Literal[...]` |
| Listener runs only once though both upstreams finished | That is `or_` | Use `and_` to wait for all |
| Input value ignored | Key misspelled; structured state drops unknown keys | Match field names exactly |
| `'StateWithId' object is not subscriptable` | Dict access on structured state | `self.state.field` |
| `Flow state model must have an 'id' field` | `initial_state = MyModel` | `class F(Flow[MyModel])` |
| `crewai run` says the flow errored but output looks right | `kickoff()` in main.py returned a value | Return `None` |
| `--inputs requires a declarative flow definition` | `crewai run --inputs` on a Python flow | Pass inputs in code or via `uv run kickoff '<json>'` |
| `invoked synchronously from within a running event loop` | `crew.kickoff()` inside `async def` | `await crew.akickoff()` or make the method sync |
| Resumed run starts from defaults | Unknown id, or no `@persist` on the class | Check the id and decorator; both cases are silent |
| Same execution id reused across runs | `inputs={"id": ...}` | `restore_from_state_id=` |
| No checkpoint files for a flow | Default `on_events=["task_completed"]` | `on_events=["method_execution_finished"]` |
| Checkpoint resume returns a label (or `None`) and runs nothing | The checkpoint was taken after a router finished | Resume from a checkpoint before the router, or re-run |
| `EOFError: EOF when reading a line` in `@human_feedback` | Console provider with no stdin | Pass `provider=` |
| Scaffolded flow ignores the `topic` input | Template `plan_content()` hard-codes `"AI Agents"` | Remove the assignment |
| `AttributeError: ... 'feedback_text'` | Old field name | `result.feedback` |
| `HumanFeedbackCollapseError` | Feedback matched no `emit` label | Clear labels, a capable `llm`, catch the error |
| `plot()` file not in the project | It writes to a temp dir | Use the returned path |

---

## 12. Checklist

- [ ] State is `Flow[MyState]` with defaults on every field; no hand-set `id`
- [ ] Every router label differs from every method name and has a listener
- [ ] Router return type is `Literal[...]` (or `emit=[...]`) so `plot()` shows the edges
- [ ] Joins use `or_` (first wins, once) or `and_` (all) deliberately
- [ ] `async def` methods `await crew.akickoff()`; sync methods call `kickoff()`
- [ ] `persist` imported from `crewai.flow` and written `@persist()`; resume uses `restore_from_state_id` (`restoreFromStateId` over HTTP)
- [ ] `CREWAI_STORAGE_DIR` set to an absolute path where state must be found again
- [ ] Checkpointed flows use `on_events=["method_execution_finished"]`; the latest file is picked by mtime; crash-prone steps sit before routers
- [ ] `@human_feedback` has the safe outcome first and as `default_outcome`; code reads `.feedback`
- [ ] `main.kickoff()` returns `None`; `[tool.crewai] type = "flow"` is present
- [ ] Ran `crewai flow plot` (or `plot(show=False)`) and checked the graph
