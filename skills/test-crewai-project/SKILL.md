# Test a CrewAI Project

How to test crews and flows deterministically, without API keys, and how to debug real runs with events and traces.

Verified against crewai 1.15.22 and 1.15.23 on 2026-10-01.
Run `crewai version` first; if the major/minor differs, re-verify the version-sensitive rows with the `ask-docs` skill.

---

## 1. Why tests need a stub LLM

A real LLM gives different text on every run, costs money, and needs a key. Every Agent without an explicit `llm` resolves to `gpt-4.1-mini` and fails at kickoff with `ValueError: OPENAI_API_KEY is required` when no key is set, so a CI run with no secrets cannot even start. You cannot assert on output you cannot predict.

A stub LLM fixes the responses, so assertions are exact. It keeps every real crewai code path: prompt building, `{placeholder}` interpolation, task context, tool execution, guardrail retries, pydantic conversion and flow routing. It also records every call, so you can assert on the prompts crewai built. That is where most bugs show up: a missing input, a dropped context, a tool that was never listed.

Test in tiers:

| Tier | Needs | What it proves |
|---|---|---|
| Unit: stub LLM, plain pytest | nothing | wiring, prompts, routing, parsing, guardrail logic |
| Guardrail truth tables | nothing | each guardrail accepts and rejects the right outputs |
| Real-model runs (`crewai test`, smoke kickoffs) | provider key, money | prompt quality; mark them `@pytest.mark.credentialed` and run offline suites with `pytest -m "not credentialed"` |

---

## 2. The custom BaseLLM contract in 1.15

`from crewai import BaseLLM`. The only abstract method is `call`. crewai passes `from_task`, `from_agent` and (for structured tasks) `response_model` as keyword arguments, so `call` must accept them.

| | `call` signature | Result |
|---|---|---|
| Bad (the public custom-LLM docs example) | `def call(self, messages, tools=None, callbacks=None, available_functions=None)` | `TypeError: MyLLM.call() got an unexpected keyword argument 'from_task'` at kickoff |
| Good | `def call(self, messages, tools=None, callbacks=None, available_functions=None, from_task=None, from_agent=None, response_model=None, **kwargs)` | runs |

| Requirement | What happens if you skip it |
|---|---|
| Accept `from_task`, `from_agent`, `response_model` (or `**kwargs`) | `TypeError` at the first LLM call |
| Pass a non-empty `model=` (e.g. `MyLLM(model="my-model")`) | `ValidationError` at construction |
| Call `self._emit_call_started_event(...)` / `self._emit_call_completed_event(...)` inside `with llm_call_context():` (from `crewai.llms.base_llm`) | event listeners and traces never see the LLM calls (see section 9) |
| `supports_function_calling()` returning False | crewai uses the ReAct text loop for tools (`Thought / Action / Action Input`) |
| Return a validated model instance when `response_model` is passed | native providers do this; returning text also works, but see section 6 for how a guardrail then sees `output.pydantic` |

`references/stub_llm.py` implements all of this. Copy it; do not write your own unless you need to.

---

## 3. Set up the test harness

1. Copy `references/stub_llm.py` to `tests/stub_llm.py` in the project.
2. `uv add --dev pytest`, then run tests with `uv run pytest`.
3. Do not run `uv run test` to mean pytest. In a scaffolded crew project `test` is a project script that runs `crewai test` (section 8), which calls a real model.
4. Add `tests/.crewai-test-storage/` to `.gitignore`.

```python
# tests/conftest.py
import os
import socket
from pathlib import Path

# Optional, test-only switches. The AGENTS.md that `crewai create` writes leaves
# turning observability off to the user, so ask before uncommenting them.
# Without them the socket guard below does not cover everything:
# - crewai telemetry is still sent to telemetry.crewai.com when the test process
#   exits, after the guard has been undone;
# - if the test job sets CREWAI_TRACING_ENABLED=true and a CrewAI token (for example
#   CREWAI_USER_PAT) is present, kickoff requests a trace upload, the guard refuses
#   it, and the test fails with TraceGrantError.
# If uncommented, they must run before crewai is imported; never put them in the project's .env.
# os.environ["CREWAI_DISABLE_TELEMETRY"] = "true"
# os.environ["CREWAI_TRACING_ENABLED"] = "false"
# os.environ["OTEL_SDK_DISABLED"] = "true"
# Absolute path: crewai's SQLite files and memory store go here instead of your user data dir.
os.environ["CREWAI_STORAGE_DIR"] = str(Path(__file__).parent / ".crewai-test-storage")

import pytest


@pytest.fixture(autouse=True)
def offline(monkeypatch, tmp_path):
    def refuse(*args, **kwargs):
        raise RuntimeError("test tried to use the network")

    monkeypatch.setattr(socket.socket, "connect", refuse)
    monkeypatch.chdir(tmp_path)  # output_file= and flow file writes land in a temp dir
```

Why each line:

- `import crewai` alone creates `<platform user data dir>/<cwd name>/`. On macOS that is `~/Library/Application Support/<cwd name>/`. Kickoffs write SQLite files there. An absolute `CREWAI_STORAGE_DIR` set before the import redirects all of it.
- The socket guard turns any accidental real-LLM call into an immediate failure instead of a hang or a bill.
- crewai's own internals emit `DeprecationWarning`s on every kickoff. To quiet them:

```toml
# pyproject.toml
[tool.pytest.ini_options]
filterwarnings = ["ignore::DeprecationWarning:crewai.*"]
```

---

## 4. Driving the stub

`StubLLM` picks each response from three sources, in this order:

| Source | Use for |
|---|---|
| `responses=[...]` | One item per LLM call, in call order. An item is a str, a dict/list (sent as JSON), a pydantic model, or `f(messages, response_model)` |
| `responder=f(messages, response_model)` | Used once the queue runs out. Decide by prompt content or schema instead of by call order |
| `default_response="..."` | Used after both. If you leave it unset and crewai asked for a `response_model`, the stub returns a skeleton JSON of that model |

Tool calls go through the ReAct loop. `tool_call(name, args)` builds the `Thought/Action/Action Input` text. The real tool `_run` executes, and its result comes back to the next LLM call as `Observation: ...`.

```python
# tests/test_structured_and_tools.py
from pydantic import BaseModel

from crewai import Agent, Crew, Task
from crewai.tools import tool
from stub_llm import StubLLM, prompt_text, tool_call


class Brief(BaseModel):
    title: str
    bullets: list[str]


tool_inputs = []


@tool("Word Counter")
def word_counter(text: str) -> int:
    """Count the words in a piece of text."""
    tool_inputs.append(text)
    return len(text.split())


def test_tool_call_then_structured_answer():
    llm = StubLLM(responses=[
        tool_call("Word Counter", {"text": "bees make honey"}),  # researcher: use the tool
        "Final Answer: 3 words",                                 # researcher: answer
        {"title": "Bees", "bullets": ["honey"]},                 # writer: JSON for Brief
    ])
    researcher = Agent(role="Researcher", goal="Count words", backstory="Careful.",
                       tools=[word_counter], llm=llm)
    writer = Agent(role="Writer", goal="Write briefs", backstory="Concise.", llm=llm)
    count = Task(description="Count the words", expected_output="A count", agent=researcher)
    brief = Task(description="Write a brief", expected_output="Title and bullets",
                 agent=writer, output_pydantic=Brief)

    out = Crew(agents=[researcher, writer], tasks=[count, brief]).kickoff()

    assert tool_inputs == ["bees make honey"]               # the real tool ran
    assert "Observation: 3" in prompt_text(llm.calls[1])    # its result went back to the LLM
    assert llm.calls[0]["response_model"] is None           # agents WITH tools get no response_model
    assert llm.calls[2]["response_model"] is Brief
    assert out.pydantic == Brief(title="Bees", bullets=["honey"])
```

Rules that keep stub tests stable:

| Rule | Why |
|---|---|
| Queue valid JSON (a dict) for every `output_pydantic` / `output_json` task | An unparseable answer makes crewai spend extra converter LLM calls, which eat later queue items, and then it raises `ConverterError` |
| `output_pydantic` is what fills `out.pydantic` | `Task(response_model=X)` alone sends the schema to the LLM but leaves `out.pydantic` as `None` |
| Count calls with `len(llm.calls)`, not `out.token_usage` | Crew usage is summed per agent, so one stub shared by 2 agents is counted twice |
| When the call order is hard to predict, use `responder` and decide on `response_model` or prompt text | A queue only works if you know the exact call order |

---

## 5. Testing a crew and asserting on prompts

Make the LLM injectable. For a factory function, take `llm=None` and pass it to every Agent (None means crewai's default model in production). For a scaffolded `@CrewBase` class, swap the LLM after `.crew()`:

```python
# tests/test_crew.py
from pathlib import Path

from acme_research.crew import AcmeResearch
from stub_llm import StubLLM, prompt_text


def crew_with(llm):
    crew = AcmeResearch().crew()
    for agent in crew.agents:
        agent.llm = llm
    return crew


def test_research_crew_output_and_prompts():
    llm = StubLLM(responses=["- bees pollinate crops", "# Bees report"])
    out = crew_with(llm).kickoff(inputs={"topic": "bees", "current_year": "2026"})

    assert out.raw == "# Bees report"
    assert [t.raw for t in out.tasks_output] == ["- bees pollinate crops", "# Bees report"]
    assert len(llm.calls) == 2

    first = prompt_text(llm.calls[0])
    assert "bees Senior Data Researcher" in first                   # {topic} filled in agents.yaml
    assert "the current year is 2026" in first                      # {current_year} in tasks.yaml
    assert "- bees pollinate crops" in prompt_text(llm.calls[1])    # task 1 output is task 2 context
    assert Path("report.md").read_text() == "# Bees report"         # output_file, in tmp cwd
```

`llm.calls[i]` holds `messages` (a snapshot of the system+user messages crewai sent), `response_model`, `tools` and `response`. `prompt_text(call)` joins the message contents. Useful things to assert on:

| Assert | Catches |
|---|---|
| An input value appears in the prompt | a missing `inputs` key (the literal `{topic}` stays in the prompt) |
| The previous task's output appears in the next prompt | broken `context=` |
| `Tool Name: <snake_case name>` appears | a tool not attached. `@tool("Word Counter")` renders as `word_counter`; `Action: Word Counter` still resolves |
| The guardrail error appears in the retry prompt | a guardrail whose feedback never reaches the model |
| `llm.calls == []` on a branch | a flow branch that should not call the model |

---

## 6. Testing guardrails

A function guardrail returns `(True, value)` to accept or `(False, "error for the LLM")` to reject. Test it two ways: as a plain function over a truth table of outputs, and inside a crew to check the retry. A guardrail that keeps failing raises `Task failed guardrail validation after N retries` after `guardrail_max_retries` retries (default 3). The truth-table and give-up tests are in [example-tests.md](references/example-tests.md) section 1.

```python
# tests/test_guardrails.py
from pydantic import BaseModel

from crewai import Agent, Crew, Task
from crewai.tasks.task_output import TaskOutput
from stub_llm import StubLLM, prompt_text


class Brief(BaseModel):
    title: str
    bullets: list[str]


def max_three_bullets(output: TaskOutput):
    try:  # output.pydantic can be None here, so fall back to parsing raw
        brief = output.pydantic or Brief.model_validate_json(output.raw)
    except ValueError:
        return (False, "Return JSON matching the Brief schema.")
    if len(brief.bullets) > 3:
        return (False, f"Use at most 3 bullets, you used {len(brief.bullets)}.")
    return (True, output.raw)  # a string: crewai re-runs the pydantic conversion


def brief_crew(llm):
    writer = Agent(role="Writer", goal="Write briefs", backstory="Concise.", llm=llm)
    task = Task(description="Write a brief", expected_output="Title and up to 3 bullets",
                agent=writer, output_pydantic=Brief,
                guardrail=max_three_bullets, guardrail_max_retries=2)
    return Crew(agents=[writer], tasks=[task])


def test_retry_feeds_the_error_back():
    llm = StubLLM(responses=[{"title": "T", "bullets": ["a", "b", "c", "d"]},
                             {"title": "T", "bullets": ["a"]}])
    out = brief_crew(llm).kickoff()
    assert out.pydantic == Brief(title="T", bullets=["a"])
    assert "Use at most 3 bullets, you used 4." in prompt_text(llm.calls[1])
```

Two traps:

- **`output.pydantic` may be `None` inside the guardrail.** When a task has a guardrail and the LLM returned text, crewai skips the pydantic conversion before the first guardrail call. An LLM returns text whenever the agent has tools, or when it is a custom LLM that returns strings. Parse `output.raw` yourself.
- **`return (True, output)` can silently lose `out.pydantic`.** If `output.pydantic` was `None`, crewai keeps that TaskOutput as-is. Return `(True, output.raw)` and crewai converts the string. Then assert `out.pydantic is not None` at the boundary.

---

## 7. Testing a flow

Flow methods are plain methods, so call them directly to test one step. Use `kickoff(inputs=...)` to test routing end to end. `kickoff` returns the return value of the last method that ran, and `inputs` keys overwrite state fields before `@start` runs.

```python
# tests/test_flow_routing.py
from pydantic import BaseModel

from crewai.flow import Flow, listen, or_, router, start


class State(BaseModel):
    topic: str = ""
    log: list[str] = []


class TopicFlow(Flow[State]):
    @start()
    def normalize(self):
        self.state.topic = self.state.topic.strip().lower()

    @router(normalize)
    def choose(self):
        return "has_topic" if self.state.topic else "no_topic"  # labels differ from method names

    @listen("has_topic")
    def research(self):
        self.state.log.append("research")

    @listen("no_topic")
    def skip(self):
        self.state.log.append("skip")

    @listen(or_(research, skip))
    def finish(self):
        return f"done:{self.state.topic or '-'}"


def test_step_directly():
    flow = TopicFlow()
    flow.state.topic = "  Bees "
    flow.normalize()
    assert flow.state.topic == "bees"
    assert flow.choose() == "has_topic"


def test_both_branches_via_kickoff():
    flow = TopicFlow()
    assert flow.kickoff(inputs={"topic": " Bees "}) == "done:bees"
    assert flow.state.log == ["research"]

    flow = TopicFlow()
    assert flow.kickoff(inputs={"topic": "   "}) == "done:-"
    assert flow.state.log == ["skip"]
```

When a flow step builds a crew itself, as the `crewai create flow` scaffold does with `ContentCrew().crew()`, there is no parameter to pass a stub through. `monkeypatch.setattr` the crew class's `crew` method with a wrapper that calls the original and then sets `agent.llm = stub` on every agent. The full test is in [example-tests.md](references/example-tests.md) section 2.

`Flow` is a pydantic model. If you own the flow code, declaring `llm: Any = None` on the flow class and passing `MyFlow(llm=stub)` is a cleaner seam than patching. A `@listen("x")` on a method named `x` raises when the flow is instantiated, so a test that only builds the flow catches it.

---

## 8. What `crewai test` actually does

`crewai test` is a model-graded evaluation, not a unit-test runner.

| Fact | Detail |
|---|---|
| What it runs | `uv run test <n> <model>`, i.e. the project's `main.test()`, which calls `Crew.test(n_iterations, eval_llm=model, inputs=...)` |
| Defaults | `-n 3`, `-m gpt-5.4-mini` (older docs say 2 and `gpt-4o-mini`) |
| Each iteration | a full real kickoff of the crew with its own LLMs |
| Scoring | an evaluator agent driven by the `-m` model scores every task from 1 to 10 and prints a table |
| Needs | keys for the crew's model AND the judge model. Without them: `An error occurred while testing the crew: OPENAI_API_KEY is required` |
| Side effects | it replaces each task's `callback` on the copy of the crew it runs |
| Flow projects | the flow scaffold has no `test` script, so `uv run test` hits the shell's `test` builtin: `test: 1: unexpected operator` |

Use it for a periodic prompt-quality check against a real model. Do not use it as CI, because it costs money and its scores are not deterministic. `Crew.test` accepts a `BaseLLM` as `eval_llm`, so with stubs for both the crew and the judge it runs offline. That checks only the wiring ([example-tests.md](references/example-tests.md) section 4).

---

## 9. Event listeners for debugging

Every kickoff emits typed events on `crewai_event_bus`: crew, task, agent, LLM call, tool, flow and memory events. Import them from `crewai.events`. `crewai.utilities.events` no longer exists.

Subclass `BaseEventListener`, implement `setup_listeners(self, bus)`, and register handlers inside it with `@bus.on(EventClass)`. Each handler has the signature `handler(source, event)`. Instantiating the listener registers its handlers. [example-tests.md](references/example-tests.md) section 3 has a debug listener (`ToolUsageFinishedEvent`, `LLMCallCompletedEvent`, `TaskFailedEvent`) and a recorder test.

In tests, register listeners inside `with crewai_event_bus.scoped_handlers():` so they are removed afterwards. Call `crewai_event_bus.flush()` before asserting, because handlers run on worker threads.

- To debug a real run, put the listener in its own module and import it from `main.py`, so it is instantiated once. Other useful events: `LLMCallFailedEvent`, `MemorySaveFailedEvent`, `CrewKickoffStartedEvent`, `FlowFinishedEvent`.
- **A custom `BaseLLM` must emit its own LLM call events.** The built-in providers emit `LLMCallStartedEvent` / `LLMCallCompletedEvent`. A subclass that only returns text emits nothing, and the trace listener subscribes to the same events, so listeners and traces both miss every LLM call.

---

## 10. Tracing and telemetry switches

They are two separate systems. **Telemetry** is anonymous usage stats sent to CrewAI. **Tracing** is the execution trace (prompts, inputs, outputs, tool calls) you view in CrewAI AMP.

| Variable | Accepted values (1.15.22-1.15.23) | Effect |
|---|---|---|
| `CREWAI_DISABLE_TELEMETRY` | `true`, `1`, `yes`, `on` (any case, trimmed) disable. `false`, `0`, `no`, `off`, empty leave it on. Anything else is ignored with a warning | turns off CrewAI telemetry |
| `CREWAI_DISABLE_TRACKING` | same as above | turns off CrewAI telemetry |
| `OTEL_SDK_DISABLED` | the same set disables CrewAI telemetry. Only `true` (any case) also blocks execution tracing and disables the OpenTelemetry SDK itself | `1` is not a full kill switch |
| `CREWAI_TRACING_ENABLED` | `true` / `1` force tracing on. `false` / `0` force it off. `yes`, `on`, `no`, `off` are **ignored** and fall through to saved consent | per-process tracing gate |
| `tracing=True/False` on `Crew(...)` or `Flow` | bool | beats the env var |

Tracing precedence: the `tracing=` argument, then `CREWAI_TRACING_ENABLED`, then the consent saved by `crewai traces enable|disable`. Saved consent is stored per project directory name (or per `CREWAI_STORAGE_DIR`), so renaming the checkout resets it. `crewai traces status` shows the effective state.

Rules:

- **Disable observability only in tests, and only when the user chooses to.** Put the switches in `tests/conftest.py` or the CI test job's environment. Never put them in the project's `.env`, `main.py`, or a deployment's env vars, because that blinds production debugging.
- Spell the values `true` / `false`. `true` is the only spelling every disable switch fully honors, and `CREWAI_TRACING_ENABLED` ignores `yes`/`no`/`on`/`off`.
- To debug one run, use `CREWAI_TRACING_ENABLED=true crewai run` or `tracing=True`. What happens next depends on the release. On 1.15.22, before any consent is saved, crewai keeps the trace in memory and asks `Share this execution trace with CrewAI? [y/N]`. On 1.15.23, in an interactive terminal, turning tracing on counts as consent: the trace is uploaded with no prompt and consent is saved on the first run (the `[y/N]` prompt remains only for first-run auto-collection). On both, without an interactive terminal (CI, pytest), a run with no CrewAI auth token discards its trace instead of uploading it, so do not rely on tracing to capture an unauthenticated CI run.
- From 1.15.23, crewai wraps every `BaseLLM` subclass's `call` in a rate-limit retry: a stub that raises an error mentioning "rate limit" or 429 is called 3 times over about 3 s before the error surfaces. To test your own rate-limit handling, raise a different error type, or assert on the retried call count.
- Traces contain task text, inputs and outputs. Use synthetic data in traced runs unless your data may leave the machine.

## Common mistakes

| Symptom | Cause | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| `TypeError: ... call() got an unexpected keyword argument 'from_task'` | custom LLM copied from the docs example signature | accept `from_task`, `from_agent`, `response_model`, `**kwargs` |
| `ValueError: OPENAI_API_KEY is required` in CI | an agent kept the default `gpt-4.1-mini` | inject the stub into every agent (section 5) |
| Test hangs or bills an account | a real LLM call slipped through | the socket guard in `conftest.py` |
| `uv run test` calls OpenAI | `test` is the scaffold's `crewai test` script | `uv run pytest` |
| Queue answers land on the wrong task | an extra converter call or guardrail retry consumed one | queue valid JSON; use `responder` keyed on `response_model` |
| `out.pydantic is None`, run "succeeded" | `response_model=` without `output_pydantic=`, or the guardrail returned `(True, output)` | use `output_pydantic`; guardrails return `(True, output.raw)`; assert not None |
| Guardrail rejects valid JSON on the first try | it read `output.pydantic`, which was None | parse `output.raw` |
| Listener or trace shows no LLM calls | custom LLM does not emit events | emit them inside `llm_call_context()` (the stub does) |
| Listener counts grow across tests | handlers registered globally | `crewai_event_bus.scoped_handlers()` + `flush()` |
| `token_usage` is double the call count | one LLM instance shared by several agents | assert on `len(llm.calls)` |
| New dirs under the user data dir after tests | `CREWAI_STORAGE_DIR` unset at import time | set it to an absolute path at the top of `conftest.py` |
| Tracing still runs with `OTEL_SDK_DISABLED=1` | `1` disables telemetry only; only `true` also blocks tracing | `CREWAI_TRACING_ENABLED=false` (tests only) |

## Checklist

- [ ] `tests/stub_llm.py` copied from `references/stub_llm.py`; pytest added as a dev dependency
- [ ] `conftest.py` sets an absolute `CREWAI_STORAGE_DIR` before importing crewai and blocks the network; the observability switches are uncommented only if the user chose them
- [ ] Every agent's LLM is injectable (factory parameter, swap after `.crew()`, or patched crew class)
- [ ] Each structured task gets valid JSON from the stub, and tests assert `out.pydantic is not None`
- [ ] At least one test asserts on prompt text (inputs, context, tool listing)
- [ ] Each guardrail has a truth-table test plus a retry test
- [ ] Each flow router branch has a kickoff test; key steps are also called directly
- [ ] Real-model tests are marked `credentialed` and excluded from default CI
- [ ] Observability switches appear only in test config, never in `.env` or deployment env vars
